Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, affiliated with the [Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). I study neurotechnology under the supervision of [Dr. Ed Boyden](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/71/11) and [Dr. Joseph Jacobson](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/jacobson/projects/). By developing tools for mapping the biomolecules in the brain, I hope we can have a deeper understanding our mind. Prior to graduate school, I was a visiting student in [Dr. Kay Tye's lab](https://tyelab.org/) studying the neural mechanism of social dominance.

My training in neuroscience shows me the power of eliciting emotion and thoughts with well-designed visual and audio stimuli (especially on mice hahahah). I have been an film director since 2015, such as "Undefined Youth", "Memory Cut Pro", "My Poetic AlphaFriend", "Decode MIT", "Robotic Dog Finding me a Girlfriend". [Watching my films](https://ruihanzhang2015.github.io/film/) is the best way to learn my philosophy and personality :-D

At MIT, I founded the [MIT Film Makers Assocation](https://engage.mit.edu/fma/home/) in the hope to get my fellow MIT friends interested in expressing themselves and resonating with other souls across space and time. I organized the [first MIT AI for filmmaking hackathon](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/mit-ai-for-filmmaking-hackathon-2023-brings-dreams-to-life/) and [the second iteration](https://engage.mit.edu/fma/about/). Hundreds of people participated in our hackathon, and we received sponsorship from top-tier startups. I was honored to co-organized the [Generative AI for visual arts workshop at CVPR 2024](https://cveu.github.io/).
