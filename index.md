Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, affiliated with the [Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). I study neurotechnology under the supervision of [Dr. Ed Boyden](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/71/11) and [Dr. Joseph Jacobson](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/jacobson/projects/). By developing tools for mapping the biomolecules in the brain, I hope we can have a deeper understanding our mind. Prior to graduate school, I was a visiting student in [Dr. Kay Tye's lab](https://tyelab.org/) studying the neural mechanism of social dominance.

My training in neuroscience shows me the power of eliciting emotion and thoughts with well-designed visual and audio stimuli (especially on mice hahahah). I have been an film director since 2015, including "Undefined Youth", "Memory Cut Pro", "My Poetic AlphaFriend", "Decode MIT", "Robotic Dog Finding a Girlfriend". Watching my films is the best way to learn my philosophy and personality. Check them here! At MIT, I founded the [MIT Film Makers Assocation](https://filmmakers.mit.edu/) in the hope to get my fellow MIT friends interested in expressing themselves and resonating with other souls across space and time. I organized the first MIT AI for filmmaking hackathon and is currently working on the second iteration.
