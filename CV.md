# Internship

### Enhancing 3D Object/Scene Generation from Sketches with Diffusion Model
AR Perception Team, Google Inc.	

Mountain View, CA, May.2023-Aug.2023

Working on 3D object generation conditioned on text and user input sketches. This project involves training an encoder to capture 3D object representations, converting representations as implicit functions (neural radiance fields) to render high resolution objects, and training diffusion models to generate novel objects conditioned on text and sketch inputs. This project holds great potential for creating 3D assets for AR/VR applications.
