# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### 2018.4-2019.2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology

- Visiting Student, Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences
- Topics: Neural circuit dynamics of prefrontal regulation of dominance via the lateral hypothalamus; Automatic multi-mice tracking and behavioral identification
- Advisor: Kay Tye, PhD
- Highlights: I mastered optogenetic experimental methods from surgeries to behavioral assays and histology. I also pioneered several dominance-related assays as well. Moreover, I lead a collaboration with Prof. Cewu Lu’s Lab in SJTU to use deep learning to automate multi-mice tracking and behavioral identification.

### 2018.1- 2018.3 University of Cambridge

- Visiting student, Dept. of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience
- Topics: The electrophysiological properties of maturing hippocampal neurons
- Advisor: Ole Paulsen, MD, PhD
- Highlights: It is very kind of Prof. Old Paulsen to let me learn electrophysiology! After two weeks of learning whole-cell patch clamping on cell culture, I patched hippocampal neurons of different cell types and developmental stages from both sides. Then I wrote MATLAB scripts to analyze their electrophysiological properties from raw traces I collected.

### 2017.7-2017.8 Duke University

- Summer Internship, Dept. of Biomedical Engineering
- Topic: Large-scale imaging and data processing of zebrafish brain with calcium sensor and voltage-sensitive dye.
- Advisor: Yiyang Gong, PhD
- Highlights: I adapted the algorithm called PCA/ICA (principle/independence component analysis) and CNMFE (constrained non-negative matrix factorization) previously used for mice for our zebrafish setup. I taught myself linear algebra and dug into all the mathematical details behind the algorithm.

### 2016.2-2018.1 Shanghai Jiao Tong University

- Undergraduate research, School of Life Sciences and biotechnology
- Topic: Functions of miRNA-7 and miR-17-92 in the arcuate nucleus in the obesity phenotype
- Advisor: Tao Sun, PhD
- Highlights: I learnt to perform qPCRs on the predicted targets of microRNAs and to validate our results with immunostaining techniques. I wrote MATLAB scripts to automate and accelerate cell counting.
- Our manuscript is available on bioRxiv: MicroRNA miR-7 and miR-17-92 in POMC neurons are associated with sex-specific regulation of diet-induced obesity
