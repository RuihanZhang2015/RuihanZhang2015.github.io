### Feb.2022-May.2022  Towards photo-realistic face swapped videos

MIT, Cambridge, MA [Course Project for 6.869 Computer Vision]

The recent advances in face swapping techniques hold great potential in storytelling for ordinary people. Face swapping conceals the identities of interviewees while preserving their contagious facial expression. In this project, we presented methods to perform face swapping in the context of protecting the identities of Asian woman interviewees. We provided an entire pipeline to synthesize artificial Asian faces, applying face swapping and video super resolution methods to enhance the spatial resolution. We show that similarity scores for face shape enables us to find the best-matching source faces, which leads to the best face swapping results. We also showed that SimSwap trained with high resolution images generate realistic face swapped videos. Applying video super methods on these face swapped videos further enhance their resolution. We hope our methods allow individuals to share their personal growth and struggles with minimal privacy concern.

- Implemented SimSwap network structure to achieve face swapping with a high resolution.

- Compared four video super resolution methods to enhance the synthesized video resolution.

### Feb.2022-May.2022  Solving American Put Option Prices with Dynamic Programming

MIT, Cambridge, MA [Course Project for 6.231 Dynamic programming and reinforcement learning]

An option is a derivative contract that gives its owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset. American options may exercise at any time before expiry. American option can be formulated as an optimal control MDP (Markov Decision Process) problem, where the underlying process is Geometric Brownian motion. In this project, we compared several methods for option pricing for option pricing. We show that the approximate value iteration and Q learning have the advantage over the naive approach for its better capturing the expected future return when establishing the mapping between current stock price, time and the option price. Q-learning has the computational advantage over approximate value iteration because the unbiased next state sampling. These methods generalized well from the single stock option to the multi-stock ETF pricing, with radial basis functions or the multi-layer perceptron as the basis function for computing features from high-dimension inputs. We demonstrated that dynamical programming methods prove a handy tool for option pricing.

- Synthesized stock price datasets by simulating trajectories with Brownian emotion.

- Implemented approximate value iteration and approximate policy iteration algorithm to compute the optimal stopping policy.

- Compared the performance of various base functions and multi-layer perceptron for approximating value function and Q function.

### Sept.2021-Nov.2021. Affect Encoding in Word Embeddings

MIT, Cambridge, MA. [Course Project for 6.864 Natural Language Processing]

A growing research interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is investigating the meaning encoded in the word embeddings from large pre-trained models. We investigated how the affect-related meaning in English lexicon are encoded in popular word embeddings in NLP. The affect theory uses notions of valence, arousal and dominance as the three dimensions of affect meaning. In our project, we used the human labeled dataset as the ground truth, and performed various tests (e.g. PCA, Spearman correlation, and logistic regression) to investigate modern word embeddings' ability to encode affect meaning. Our results showed interesting correlations between several tested word embeddings and human affect senses. Furthermore, we fine-tuned a BERT-based model with affect-value regression task and applied it on a downstream affect-related task to study the effect of our affect intervention with transfer learning and few-shot learning. Embeddings from enhanced affect encoding had much better performance than vanilla BERT model. This result suggests that affective embeddings can be helpful on such sentiment-analysis tasks and the methodology of enhancing the affective dimensions of word embeddings can be applied generally in the specific domains of natural language processing.

<!-- • Studied how contextualized word embedding in NLP models encodes richer affective information compared to static word embeddings. -->

- Wrote dataloaders for various input datasets to different language models.

- Demonstrated the utility of contextualized word embedding in encoding affect information in the few-shot learning scheme.
