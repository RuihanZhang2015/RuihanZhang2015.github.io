# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### [Course project] Affect Encoding in Word Embeddings

**Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA**

**Sept.2021-Nov.2021**

• Studied how contextualized word embedding encodes richer affective information compared to static word embeddings.

• Demonstrated the utility of such contextualized word embedding in encoding affect information in the few-shot learning scheme.

### [Research project]  AlphaTracker: A Multi-Animal Tracking and Behavioral Analysis Tool

**Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Cambridge, MA** 

**Apr.2018-July.2022**

• Initiated and led the collaboration with a computer vision group to adapt multi-object tracking, pose estimation and unsupervised clustering algorithms for analyzing rodent social behavior.

• Supervised the development of a JavaScript and HTML based UI for result inspection and interactive correction of the tracking errors, which greatly enhanced the throughput of behavior analysis.

MIT, Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Cambridge, MA Researcher, Mapping Spatial Transcriptome of an Entire Vertebrate Brain

Jan. 2020-present • Designed and led the project to map the RNA expression profiles of the zebrafish brain.

• Developed the imaging analysis (registration, stitching, segmentation) tools for terabyte level data in collaboration with a computer vision group.

• Developed bioinformatic tools which selected cell type marker genes in R and Python.


### 2018.4-2019.2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology

- Visiting Student, Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences
- Topics: Neural circuit dynamics of prefrontal regulation of dominance via the lateral hypothalamus; Automatic multi-mice tracking and behavioral identification
- Advisor: Kay Tye, PhD
- Highlights: I mastered optogenetic experimental methods from surgeries to behavioral assays and histology. I also pioneered several dominance-related assays as well. Moreover, I lead a collaboration with Prof. Cewu Lu’s Lab in SJTU to use deep learning to automate multi-mice tracking and behavioral identification.

### 2018.1- 2018.3 University of Cambridge

- Visiting student, Dept. of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience
- Topics: The electrophysiological properties of maturing hippocampal neurons
- Advisor: Ole Paulsen, MD, PhD
- Highlights: It is very kind of Prof. Old Paulsen to let me learn electrophysiology! After two weeks of learning whole-cell patch clamping on cell culture, I patched hippocampal neurons of different cell types and developmental stages from both sides. Then I wrote MATLAB scripts to analyze their electrophysiological properties from raw traces I collected.

### 2017.7-2017.8 Duke University

- Summer Internship, Dept. of Biomedical Engineering
- Topic: Large-scale imaging and data processing of zebrafish brain with calcium sensor and voltage-sensitive dye.
- Advisor: Yiyang Gong, PhD
- Highlights: I adapted the algorithm called PCA/ICA (principle/independence component analysis) and CNMFE (constrained non-negative matrix factorization) previously used for mice for our zebrafish setup. I taught myself linear algebra and dug into all the mathematical details behind the algorithm.

### 2016.2-2018.1 Shanghai Jiao Tong University

- Undergraduate research, School of Life Sciences and biotechnology
- Topic: Functions of miRNA-7 and miR-17-92 in the arcuate nucleus in the obesity phenotype
- Advisor: Tao Sun, PhD
- Highlights: I learnt to perform qPCRs on the predicted targets of microRNAs and to validate our results with immunostaining techniques. I wrote MATLAB scripts to automate and accelerate cell counting.
- Our manuscript is available on bioRxiv: MicroRNA miR-7 and miR-17-92 in POMC neurons are associated with sex-specific regulation of diet-induced obesity
